# facial-keypoints
Using deep learning architecture to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. our architecture is inspired and trained by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf) and [this Data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=127CzxN-gX6Q4u6TgWF5LieyGHZljuDEQ)
